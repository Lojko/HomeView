HomeView
========

The HomeView application was the artefact I developed for my Final Year Project whilst studying on a BSc (Hons) Software Development course at Teesside University. It was written in C# and uses the DirectShow and DirectSound libraries. The application was intended to be a financially inexpensive, surveillance application to be used in the home. However, additional functionality was added to the original version which allows the application to be used on a machine which is harder to access through use of hands free kinect control.

HomeView utilizes USB Web cameras and transforms them into CCTV cameras. Functionally, it can:

Display upto 4 live video streams and play 4 live audio streams (only one can be listened to at a time).
Display motion detection on live video streams.
Create output files (.AVI) when an ‘incident’ is triggered (either manually or via motion detection).
Allows review of the incident through the intuitive graphical user interface.
Provide hands free control through the use of a Kinect device.
